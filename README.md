  <h2>:book: Description</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>:video_game: A simple endless-score arcade game with real lore</li>
    <li>:snake: Created with the use of the PyGame Python library</li>
    <li>:books: Done as a project for high school computer science class</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>:grey_question: Installation Guide</h2>
  <p>There are three core .py files, each with their own versions.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>"Fruit Loot v1.0" is the very first iteration that was handed in as the class project</li>
    <li>"Fruit Loot v1.5" is a revision that fixed some bugs and added some features</li>
    <li>"Fruit Loot v2.0" is an overhaul to the code structure using university-level techniques</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    To play, download all the files and folders into one common folder and launch any of the three core files through an accredited Python IDE.
    This program uses the pygame, random, and time libraries to run properly so make sure to have all of them installed on your system.
